# Code-Solution
# 🚀 Problem-Solving Repository

Welcome to my repository!
Here I share my code solutions to various algorithmic and data-structure problems that I solve on different **online judges** such as Codeforces, LeetCode, AtCoder, CSES, and others.

---

## 📌 About

* This repository is a collection of my **personal solutions** to competitive programming problems.
* It serves as both a **practice archive** and a **reference** for anyone interested in problem-solving approaches.
* I aim to keep the code **clean, well-structured, and commented** (where necessary).

---

## 📂 Structure

* Each solution is stored inside folders categorized by platform or topic.
* File names usually reflect the **problem name** or **contest number**.

Example:

```
/Codeforces/
    1234A.cpp
    5678B.cpp
/CSES/
    increasing_subsequence.cpp
    dice_combinations.cpp
```

## 🛠️ Languages Used

* Mostly **C++ (17/20)** for competitive programming.
* Sometimes **Python** for quick scripting or math-heavy problems.

---

## 🎯 Goals

* To track my progress in problem-solving.
* To build a resource that can help others learn new approaches.
* To improve speed, accuracy, and coding style for contests.
